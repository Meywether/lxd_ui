If you would like to contribute in any way to this project then please feel free, all contributions are welcome. 

You don't need to know how to code to contribute, there are many things which can always be improved.

### Finding Bugs

If you have found a bug then please open an issue and report it, don't just give up if something is broken or not working as expected. For the most part, the developer/s do not use all the complex features you might be wanting to use, so things could be overlooked.

### Documention

There is currently no documentation for the project :( 

Not all users are savvy with the inner workings of LXD, so it can be difficult to get started or understand what the project is, how it works, how its used or how it fits in. 
So if you enjoy/tolerate writing documentation and would like to contribute to help out struggling users, then it would be greatly appreciated! 

### Code

Contributions to the codebase is always welcome, refactoring, improving and adding features, adding unit tests and all that good stuff. If you can help in any way then please do.

All contributors which have helped make this project better in any way will get listed in the contributor's section of the readme.
